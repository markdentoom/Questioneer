## Getting started (backend):

1. Ensure you have python 3.9 installed on your machine
2. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate it using `venv/scripts/activate`
4. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run migrations using `python manage.py migrate`
6. Create a superuser using `python manage.py createsuperuser`
7. Launch the project using `python manage.py runserver`
8. Click the url in your terminal to open the project in browser

## For developers:

- You can sort your python imports using `isort --recursive .`
- Use the `REST Client` vscode extension by Huachao Mao for API testing (as an alternative to Postman)
- I suggest using the `Vetur` vscode extension by Pine Wu for help with Vue development.
